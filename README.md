# Welcome to VotingApp!

## Where your vote makes all the difference.

Here is the source code for a website that allows for a 1v1, knockout-style competition where participants register and users vote to eliminate one singer each round until one remains. You can see the website running and most of its features as of 28th/11/17 [here](https://youtu.be/b5qiU0VBLk8). This project was built using the Django web framework. If you want to use it and/or modify it, you'll need to have the following:

`Python` and `Django` for basic usability.

`Pygal` and `lxml` for charts visualization.

`Yagmail` to handle emails (users receive an email when they've voted showing them their choice).

This is a prototype and I'm welcome to constructive criticism and/or improvements. Feel free to use the code provided as a basis for any of your related projects.
